This the story of three little bears. One day they 
went out for a trip. While they were gone, a vistor came to

Then she sat in the other chair and it was too small. She tried the last chair,
and it was just right.

The visitor started watching TV.  She watched two TVs she didn't like and then kept the third one.

Unfortunately, the three bears called their cousins the three sharks, and the three sharks flew in their candy powered plane and arrested the girl for breaking and entering as well as theft of bear food. The charge of theft was dropped as the bears had stolen the food themselves, and the girl spent one year in jail.
