Hello my name is Adam and this is my story.
This the story of three little bears. One day they 
went out for a trip. While they were gone, a vistor came to
their house.

First the visitor tried to sit in a chair but it was too big.
Then she sat in the other chair and it was too small. She tried the last chair,
and it was just right.

The bears came home to find the girl eating all their food.
They yelled at the girl to leave their house, and she did.
She returned north of the border. She was content to be away
from the rude people from bear country. 

Unfortunately, the three bears called their cousins the three sharks, and the three sharks flew in their candy powered plane and arrested the girl for breaking and entering as well as theft of bear food. The charge of theft was dropped as the bears had stolen the food themselves, and the girl spent one year in jail.
