This the story of three little bears. One day they 
went out for a trip. While they were gone, a vistor came to
their house.

First the visitor tried to sit in a chair but it was too big.
Then she sat in the other chair and it was too small. She tried the last chair,
and it was just right.

The visitor started watching TV.  She watched two TVs she didn't like and then kept the third one.

The bears came home to find the girl eating all their food.
They yelled at the girl to leave their house, and she did.
She returned north of the border. She was content to be away
from the rude people from bear country. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The girl moved to the city and became a big city journalist.
The newspaper she worked for sent her BACK to bear country
in order to do a big report on the honey shortage. There
were bear riots in which they were punching bee hives and 
eating an excessive amount of salmon...needless to say...
This story changed the girls life for ever.
