This the story of three little bears. One day they 
went out for a trip. While they were gone, a vistor came to
their house.

First the visitor tried to sit in a chair but it was too big.
Then she sat in the other chair and it was too small. She tried the last chair,
and it was just right.

The bears came home to find the girl eating all their food.
They yelled at the girl to leave their house, and she did.
She returned north of the border. She was content to be away
from the rude people from bear country.

But the bears weren't content at all. In fact, they were pretty upset. Their food gone, their house in shambles, the bears chased the girl followed the vistor back to her home. The bears formulated a plan to tear apart the girl's house. They waited until nightfall to make their move on the house. It neared night fall when the girl left her home. The bears seized the opportunity and made their move on the house. Once the bears were inside, they noticed the girl's home wasn't well at all. There was no fridge, no television, and there was hardly a bed. The bears felt bad for the girl and left her home never to see the girl again.
