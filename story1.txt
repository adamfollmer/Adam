Hello my name is Adam and this is my story.
This the story of three little bears. One day they 
went out for a trip. While they were gone, a vistor came to
their house.

First the visitor tried to sit in a chair but it was too big.
Then she sat in the other chair and it was too small. She tried the last chair,
and it was just right.

Next, the visitor tried the bears kombucha, but it was too sour and efervescent.
Then, she tried the peach faygo and it was too sweet. 
Last, she tried the Old English and it was just right.

The bears came home to find the girl eating all their food.
They yelled at the girl to leave their house, and she did.
She returned north of the border. She was content to be away
from the rude people from bear country.
