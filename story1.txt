This the story of three little bears. One day they 
went out for a trip. While they were gone, a vistor came to
their house.

First the visitor tried to sit in a chair but it was too big.
Then she sat in the other chair and it was too small. She tried the last chair,
and it was just right.

She was so curious how things in the house were so great and it was left empty.

The bears came home to find the girl eating all their food.
They yelled at the girl to leave their house, and she did.
She returned north of the border. She was content to be away
from the rude people from bear country.
